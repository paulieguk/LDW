#Challenge 1 - Scenario 2
## Unable to access LOD Lab hosted Website across the Internet

Issue: During testing it has been discovered that the website on VM WKS-11 is not available across the Internet. Information to help diagnose the problem:
 - The pFSense router is failing to boot in a timely fashion
 - Website should be accessible on Public IP Address @lab.VirtualMachine(pFsense-Scenario1-2).NetworkAdapter(WAN).IpAddress
 - The Website is served via HTTP
 - All firewalls have been tested and are configured correctly.  The pFsense has to remain to protect the Website.
 - Try connecting from your local browser to the ip address ++@lab.VirtualMachine(pFsense-Scenario1-2).NetworkAdapter(WAN).IpAddress++
